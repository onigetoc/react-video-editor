## 📋 TODO

- [ ] Fix the Fit function
- [ ] Audio search from API
- [ ] All Timeline visualization with some bugs
- [ ] Right Sidebar from selected media. Lot of features just don't work
- [ ] May be simplify timeline miniature to only one image because is too slow to generate and do not generate if we do others actions before the generation.
